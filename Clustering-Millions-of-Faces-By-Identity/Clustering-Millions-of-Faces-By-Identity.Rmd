## Clustering Millions of Faces by Identity

The article was written by [@otto2018]. It was was cited [44](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9743611198042490448&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en) times according to Google Scholar. The task performed was face clustering. They used the F-measure metric over clusters with distractor images. They also developed their own metric for measuring internal cluster quality using just the k-top nearest neighbors.

### Hypothesis
Deep features clustered using only the top-k nearest neighbors in rank-order clustering will produce a more scalable and a more accurate face clustering algorithm. This algorithm will be able to overcome the presence of millions distractor images and class imbalance.

The network architecture to produce a 320D feature vector was VGG16 proposed by [@Simonyan2014]. The rank-order clustering algorithm is based on [@zhu2011]. Their k-d tree implementation for calculating just the 200-top nearest neighbors is based on [@muja2014]. 

### Evidence and Results
Evidence is presented first over a small dataset and the over an augmented version of the datasets with million of distractor images.

#### Dataset


#### Results

### Contribution

Firstly, the authors improved the Rank-Order clustering algorithm proposed by [@zhu2011]. The original Rank-Order has the disadvantage that it requires $O(n^2)$. The authors propose to use the FLANN library implementation of the randomized k-d tree algorithm to compute the list of top-k nearest neighbors. Just one iteration is used.

Secondly, the authors improved the internal quality metric of Modularization quality (MQ) [@mancoridis1998] by just counting shared neighbors in the top-k nearest neighbors list. Cluster's external quality was obviated.
