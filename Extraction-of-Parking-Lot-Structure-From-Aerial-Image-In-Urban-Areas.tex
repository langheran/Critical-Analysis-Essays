\subsection{Extraction of Parking Lot Structure From Aerial Image In Urban Areas}\label{extraction-of-parking-lot-structure-from-aerial-image-in-urban-areas}}

The article was written by \autocite{koutaki2016extraction}. It was was cited \href{https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Extraction\%20of\%20Parking\%20Lot\%20Structure\%20From\%20Aerial\%20Image\%20In\%20Urban\%20Areas\%20koutaki\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0\&as_vis=1\&oi=scholart\&sa=X\&ved=0ahUKEwiN67qBocbWAhXrjVQKHcX0BYwQgQMIMDAA}{0} times according to Google Scholar. The task performed was detecting rectangular parking lot areas from aerial images. The metric for measuring performance is correctness., i.e.~the ratio between the correctly extracted parking lots and the total extracted parking lots. They also use a \% of detection metric, equal to the ratio between parking spots correctly extracted and the total real parking spots.

\hypertarget{hypothesis}{%
\subsubsection{Hypothesis}\label{hypothesis}}

Combining vehicle detection with parking spot detection will be useful to detect rectangular parking lot structures.

\subsubsection{Evidence and Results}\label{evidence-and-results}}

\hypertarget{dataset}{%
\paragraph{Dataset}\label{dataset}}

For vehicle detection 2520 positive image patches of 14x32 pixels were used. Likewise, 4800 negative patches were used. For parking space detection a single image patch of 15x28 pixels was used.

For parking lot detection, 4 images of 2000x2000 pixels were used. Zoom level is 20cm per pixel.

The images were used to train a Haar-like detector in conjunction with an AdaBoost ensemble classifier.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\paragraph{Results}\label{results}}

The parking lot rows were deduced using hierarchical grouping, starting with those parking spots that their centers are just one width of a parking spot apart.

The authors achieved 66.9\% completeness detecting vehicles, 30.2\% completeness for parking spot detection and correctness of 95\% in rectangular parking lot extraction. In the later case, a completeness of 100\% is assumed.

\hypertarget{contribution}{%
\subsubsection{Contribution}\label{contribution}}

First, the paper thoroughly defines the geometric structure and appearance model of the parking lot.

Second, high resolution elevation data is used to remove buildings. They combined a Digital Elevation Model and a Digital Surface Model with digital interpolation with the 4 urban zone images.

Third, a method for extracting those parking lots is proposed. This method is based on extracting both parking spaces and vehicle detection in parallel.

\hypertarget{weaknesses}{%
\subsubsection{Weaknesses}\label{weaknesses}}

No comparison with other methods is shown. All the parking lots are assumed to be rectangular. A single angle of 90 degrees between the parking spot and the parking row is assumed.

\hypertarget{future-work}{%
\subsubsection{Future Work}\label{future-work}}

For future work, the authors mention a shadow-resistant vehicle detection and to improve the single parking space extraction. Also, the authors mention that they wish to extend the algorithm to detect parking lots of arbitrary shape.
