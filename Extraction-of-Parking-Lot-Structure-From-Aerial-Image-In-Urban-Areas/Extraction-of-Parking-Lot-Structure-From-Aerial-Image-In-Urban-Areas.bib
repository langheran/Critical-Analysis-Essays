abstract     = {Many applications of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in recent years have been used and the digital maps containing detailed information have been required. However, in the current technology, the digital maps including many geometric objects such as roads, buildings, road markings, parking lots, are generated manually and it requires much cost. Thus, to reduce the cost of generation of maps, this study aims to achieve automatic extraction of parking lot area from aerial images. Our contributions as follows: (1) we define a detailed geometric structure and appearance model of parking lot, and (2) we propose a method of parking lots extraction using both of parking space and vechile detection. In an experiment using actual images, over half the number of vehicles were accurately detected, showing that successful detection is also possible in parking space extraction. We have shown that, despite the complexity of the images, a large number of parking lot areas can be extracted. Keywords: Parking lot, Aerial image, Car detection},
